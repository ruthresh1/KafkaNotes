# KafkaNotes

Kafka is a distributed and scalable messaging system for real-time consumption of messages. It outperforms traditional messaging systems in many ways.

## Use cases
* messaging system - real time messages can be sent and received in millions
* activity tracking - aggregate user activing on a website for offline processing
* real time stream processing - process continuous stream of information in real time and pass it along
* log aggregation - collect multiple logs from different systems and store, like in HDFS
* commit log service - external commit log for distributed systems
* event sourcing - maintaining time ordered sequence of events
